# Evaluate News NLP

This project aims to produce a Natural Language Processing News Application. This is a project for the Udacity Front End Development NanoDegree Program.

##How to run this app.

You will need to request an API Key from the Aylien Text Api to use this code. For security reasons, my code will not be attached to this repository.

Webpack, Express, Node, and Sass, and Service Workers modules are used for this app.
